# OMF Community Resources

Welcome to the Open Metaverse Foundation (OMF) Community documentation. This is a central location for information related to our work, the processes our projects uses and how to contribute with them. 

First and foremost, ensure you read the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [values](values.md) guides. Then reach out to *Foundational Interest Groups* (FIGs) that are involved in the areas you want to contribute to.

## How can you contribute?

**Participate in the meetings**
As we just started our works, joining the meetings is essential to give feedback and influence how the future metaverse will look like. Everyone is welcome and, for every group, we have an agenda posted few days before, and we also need people who volunteer for taking notes or even facilitate the meetings!

This is the current agenda for the meetings:
|    **Group**    | **Periodicity** | **Date** |
|:---------------:|:---------------:|:--------:|
| General Meeting |     Biweekly    |   (TBA)  |

You can also check out our [calendar](https://lists.openmv.org/g/calendar/calendar) for events and past meeting notes.

**Contribute in our documentation and guidelines**
Whether it's filing an issue, updating existing docs, or even writing completely new docs - we highly appreciate all efforts to improving the documentation. We are still developing standard ways to take notes as of now!
